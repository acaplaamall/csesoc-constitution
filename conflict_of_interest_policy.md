# Conflict of Interest Policy

This policy applies to anyone involved internally in CSESoc or otherwise organising events with CSESoc:

  - Anyone directly involved in organising an event is ineligible to win any prizes or compete. Notably, subcom who are not involved in organising an event can compete for prizes.

  - Execs are ineligible to win any prizes. However, Execs are allowed to compete if they are not directly involved in organising the event. It should be made clear to both the Execs and participants that  any participating Execs are ineligible for prizes.

  - Anyone who is eligible to compete for prizes must not have access to any confidential material related to the event. That is, planning documents should not be placed in the CSESoc Google Drive folder without first adjusting permissions.

    - For any coding competitions, participants must not have early access to questions.

    - For any hackathons, participants must not have access to material for judges, submissions from other participants, scoring of other participants, etc and must not have early access to themes

Any suspected breaking of this policy should be reported to the CSESoc GEDI Officer, or the respective chain as defined by the CSESoc Grievance Policy, if the suspect is the GEDI officer.

Grievances as a result will be handled as outlined by the CSESoc Grievance Policy.
